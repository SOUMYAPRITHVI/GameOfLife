# Game of Life 

## Description

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Pygame.
## Rules 
- If a live cell has fewer than two live neighbors or more than three live neighbors, it dies (new state = 0).
- If a live cell has two or three live neighbors, it survives (new state = 1).
- If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes alive (new state = 1).

## Features

- Grid-based simulation
- Pygame for visualization
- List-based approach for cell state management

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (install using `pip install pygame`)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-of-life-pygame.git
